Put your answers in a Word document and upload it here. Double-space, and use a normal sized font. Include short quotes and references to what is in the articles—and, when you do so, give the page number. Your paper should be about a page long, although it can be longer. Don’t include the description of the assignment with your essay.

The following models or theories of sexual harassment are discussed in May’s and Leeser and O’Donohue’s articles: the intimidation model, discriminatorily abusive work environment, May’s account, Superson’s model, Wall’s model, and Leeser and O’Donohue’s (plus there is coercion, but don’t use that concept by itself for this assignment, although you can include it with one of the models just listed).

Read the passage below. (It is a real case that occurred in 2018, and it is offensive). Pick the model that you think best accounts for the sexual harassment described in the case (or best explains that sexual harassment did occur). Explain in detail why the model that you selected fits. (There are different correct answers, but if you pick a model that doesn’t seem to be a good fit and you don’t adequately explain why it applies to this case, then you might not have a correct answer.) Let me know if you have questions about the assignment.

> Soon after beginning her job, a female employee received text messages and phone calls on a regular basis from one of her supervisors. After a few months, the intensity of texts and calls increased, as did the context of the messages. The messages repeatedly stated that the colleague loved the female worker, he made unwanted expressions of his feelings and emotions, and he made excessive compliments about her appearance. The messages referred to her as “sweetie,” “sweetheart” and “darling.” He sent her a picture of a bra and said, “I walked past a lingerie shop tonight and saw this massive bra and thought of you. You’re the only girl I know that could fill it.” Another message included an image of the woman’s work ID and said, “I’m smelling your ID and it smells lovely. I think I’ll take it home with me for the night. Don’t worry, I’ll wash it before I hand it back tomorrow.” In another he said, “I have absolutely no interest in being intimate with anyone but you.”
>
> She alleged that after reporting the sexual harassment, she was told to avoid the workplace and the supervisor was promoted. When asked about his behavior, the supervisor stated that he believed their friendship was at a point that he could say the things he had said.
