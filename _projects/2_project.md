These are drafts of the chapters for a short introduction to analytic philosophy. Hopefully, to be finished someday. In addition to these three, I plan to add a chapter on personhood and identity.

[What is ethics anyway?](/assets/pdf/intro/What_Is_Ethics_Anyway.pdf) A shorter version of this chapter was published [The Montreal Review](https://www.themontrealreview.com/2009/What-Is-Ethics-Anyway.php).

[What is the mind and who has one?](/assets/pdf/intro/what_is_the_mind.pdf)

[Could I have taken the other road? Determinism versus Libertarianism](/assets/pdf/intro/libertarianism_and_determinism.pdf)
