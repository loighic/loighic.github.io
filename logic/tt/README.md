Truth Table Generator
=====================

This is a JavaScript program that will generate a truth table given a well-formed formula of truth-functional logic. To include more than one formula in a single table, list the formulas separated by commas.  Tables can be displayed in html (either the full table or the column under the main connective only), plain text, or LaTeX. You can also select  which symbols to use for the two truth values and the connectives.

The output characters used for the various connectives can be changed by modifying the `htmlchar()`, `txtchar()`, and `latexchar()` functions at the beginning of `truthtable.js`.

This version of the program is here: https://loighic.net/logic/tt/truthtable.html
