I am an instructor of philosophy and economics at Mississippi State University ([Meridian](https://www.meridian.msstate.edu/academics/arts-sciences/) & [Starkville](https://www.philosophyandreligion.msstate.edu)). My primary areas of research are philosophy of psychology and philosophy of neuroscience.

I am also the co-chair for the History and Philosophy of Science Division in the Mississippi Academy of Sciences. The program for the 2024 meeting is [here](https://loighic.net/mas_hps/2024program/).
