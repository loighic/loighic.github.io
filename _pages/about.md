I am an instructor of philosophy and economics at Mississippi State University ([Meridian](https://www.meridian.msstate.edu/academics/arts-sciences/) & [Starkville](https://www.philosophyandreligion.msstate.edu)). My primary areas of research are philosophy of psychology and philosophy of neuroscience, and I mainly work on the relationship between explanations in cognitive psychology and those in neurobiology. I am also the author of *[Argument & Inference: An Introduction to Inductive Logic](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262035255/argument-and-inference/)* (MIT Press) and the co-author of [two open source textbooks](/teaching).

Since 2019, I have been a co-chair for the History and Philosophy of Science Division in the Mississippi Academy of Sciences. The call for abstracts for the 2025 meeting is [here](https://loighic.net/assets/pdf/mas/CFA_MAS_2025.pdf).
