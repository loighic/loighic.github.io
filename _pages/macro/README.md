This principles of macroeconomics contains only what I use when teaching this course. Some content is taken from the [OpenStax Principles of Macroeconomics](https://openstax.org/details/books/principles-macroeconomics-3e), but most of it is a write up of my notes (plus figures, tables, and short videos). The emphasis in my course---which is, perhaps, reflected in the textbook---is on problem solving. Consequently, there is less emphasis on learning the breadth of terms and ideas that are covered in the published textbooks.

Other instructors are welcome to use all or any part of it, and it can easily be modified to reflect other instructor's goals and content for the course. Putting a modified version of the textbook on a different site can be done using a [Jekyll template](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
