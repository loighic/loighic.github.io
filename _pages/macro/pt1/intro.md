#### A brief introduction to economics

##### What is economics?

*Economics* is the study of how humans make choices under conditions of scarcity. *Scarcity*, in this context, means that people want more of---and would, if possible, consume more of---a good, service, or resource than is available. So, this isn't scarce in the way that we typically use the term. The good, service, or resource might seem quite plentiful, but, nonetheless, everyone cannot have as much of it as they want.

For example, beef, in the United States, is plentiful, but it's still "scarce" in the economic sense. There's not an unlimited supply and people make trade-offs to get it. So, what isn't scarce? Breathable air, at least for the time being, is not scarce. (Which is not to say that 'clean air' isn't scarce.) A computer program that can be copied and used for free is not scarce. Seawater, although limited, is also not scarce in the economic sense.

A central issue of economics, then, is how to turn resources (which are limited and scarce) into goods and services (which are, therefore, also limited and scarce). This problem of scarcity raises these kinds of questions:

> How do we turn resources into goods and services?
>
> Which resources do we want to turn into goods and services?
>
> How are we going to distribute those goods and services?

Since these are the kinds of questions with which economics is concerned, economics is really a decision science.


##### Resources

There are four categories of resources: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. As just mentioned, all of these are limited and scarce---i.e., there is not an infinite amount of any of them, and people would use more of them if more was available.

1. **Land** includes all natural resources: land itself---forests and arable land (i.e., land where crops can be grown)---as well as, for instance, minerals, water, and energy resources.

2. **Labor** is the resource that is provided (or is providable) by workers. Whereas natural resources are one type of input needed to produce goods, labor is another required input.

3. **Capital**, in economics, are the resources that are (*a*) made, (*b*) facilitate the production of goods and services, and (*c*) are not used up shortly after being produced. So, for example, *factories*, *equipment*, and *distribution networks* are types of capital.

4. **Entrepreneurship** is the ability to combine land, labor and capital to produce goods and services.



##### Factor payments

When producing goods and services, land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship are the *inputs* or *factors of production*. *Factor payments* are the payments made to use each type of factor. For land the payment is rent, for labor it is wages, for capital it is interest, and for entrepreneurship it is profit. The more alternative uses a resource has, the higher the factor payments will be. The fewer the alternative uses, the lower the factor payments will be. So, for example, the more options a person has for his or her labor, the higher will be his or her wage.



##### Goods

*Goods* in economics are those things that are scarce, desirable, and wanted in quantities beyond what is available. For example, houses, books, clothes, clean drinking water, leisure time (non-tangible goods also count) are all goods. In contrast are things that we don't want: for example, pollution or crime. (Although some things may be wanted by some people and not by others---e.g., certain kinds of meat as food \[from cows, or from pigs, or from whales\] or meat in general.)


##### Economic models

To help understand the economy, economists often create models. A model is a simplified representation of something, in this case, the economy. One very simple model of the economy is the **circular flow diagram**. In this model, the economy consists of two groups, *households* and *firms*, that interact in two markets: the goods and services market and the labor market. In the first market, firms sell goods and services to households (which, therefore, buys the goods and services). In the second, households sell labor to firms (and so the firms buy the labor).

<strong>Figure 1: The Circular Flow Diagram</strong> The circular flow diagram shows how households and firms interact in the (1) goods and services market and (2) labor market. The direction of the arrows shows that, in the goods and services market, households receive goods & services and pay firms for them (arrows A and B). In the labor market, households provide labor and receive payment from firms through wages, salaries, and benefits (arrows C and D).</div>
</div>
</div>


Of course, in the real world, there are many different markets for goods and services and markets for many different types of labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the description of the economy easier to grasp. Nonetheless, this model has enough features to illustrate how production and labor interact. And we can add details to this basic model if we want to introduce more real-world elements, such as financial markets, governments, or trade with other countries.


##### Graphing

Graphing is super-duper important in economics, and it doesn't ever go away. When you are making graphs yourself, it helps to make them large, to use multiple colors, and, if a graph will be seen by others, to make a draft and then a neater, final version.

Most of the graphs that you will encounter in this course will be line graphs, which represent the relationship between two variables, which are called the *independent* and the *dependent variables*.

> **the independent variable:** the value of this variable is not dependent on the value of the other values being studied. (Usually, this variable is on the horizontal axis of the graph.)
>
> **the dependent variable**: the value of this variable *depends on* the value of the independent variable. (Usually, this variable is on the vertical axis.)

The relationship between the two variables can be positive, negative, or complex.

> **A positive relationship** exists when it is the case that, as the value of the independent variable increases, the value of the dependent variable also increases. On a graph, when there is a positive relationship between the variables, the line will have a positive slope.
>
> **A negative relationship** exists when it is the case that, as the value of the independent variable increases, the value of the dependent variable decreases. On a graph, when there is a negative relationship between the variables, the line has a negative slope.
>
> **A complex relationship** exists when the relationship between the variables has both positive and negative components.

Here is a set of data. The variables are *infant mortality rate* and *per capita GDP*.

<table class="styled-table">
<thead>
	<tr>

		<th></th>
	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>

		<td>$6,100</td>
		<td>(India)</td>
	</tr>
<tr>

</tr>

</tr>
</tbody>
<caption>Table 1</caption>
</table>


The independent variable is *per capital GDP*, and as we can see, as the value of this variable increases, the value of the dependent variable, *infant mortality rate*, decreases. Hence, there is a negative relationship between the two variables. This relationship is illustrated in the graph in figure 4.

Now, let's look at a graph from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (or FRED) website: <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/> . We will use this site throughout the course, and so you should familiarize yourself with it. If you go to the site, you can find the graph below by putting "gdp" in the search field, and then selecting "Gross Domestic Product."

<div class="caption"><div align="left"><strong>Figure 5 U.S. nominal GDP</strong> You can probably find the interruption to GDP caused by the covid pandemic. The decline in GDP ten years before the covid pandemic was caused by the 2007--2008 financial crisis.</div></div>


This is a graph of **nominal GDP**. The years from 19547 to the present (or the last time that the data were reported) are on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is given in billions of dollars. This means that 1 (which isn't show on the axis) is \$1 billion. 4,000, the first value on the axis, is \$4,000 billion or \$4,000,000,000,000, which is \$4 trillion. The last reported figure, therefore, will be some number over \$27,000,000,000,000 (depending on when you are looking at this). 

Looking at numbers in billions of dollars is probably unfamiliar to you, but try to remember that the GDP of the United States---the highest GDP in the world---is not \$27,000 or \$28,000 or \$29,000. It's \$27 or \$28 or \$29 trillion (again, depending on when you are looking at this).



#### Important economic ideas

##### Microeconomics and macroeconomics

The distinction between microeconomics and macroeconomics is not a perfectly clean one in practice (and we'll cover some microeconomics topics in this course). The general idea, however, is that microeconomics focuses on the decisions and actions of individual agents (i.e., individual persons, but also single households or firms). Macroeconomics, meanwhile, focuses on the "big picture", the economy as a whole. You might think of this as 'aggregate economics' since it is the study of the aggregate: the actions and decisions of all of the individual economic agents.

##### Markets

A **market** is the group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service who come together (in-person or virtually) to transact---as happens in, for instance, the Chicago housing market, the stock market, the [Starkville Community Market](https://starkville.org/things-to-do/starkville-community-market/) or the [127 Yard Sale](https://www.facebook.com/127yardsale/). In a market economy, these interactions determine how resources are used, what goods are produced, what quantities are produced, and what the prices will be.

The opposite of a market economy is a **planned** or **command economy**. In such an economy, a central authority makes these decisions. The government decides what goods and services will be produced and how they will be produced. It also decides what prices it will charge for goods and services, and it sets wages for workers. Currently, Cuba and North Korea have command economies.

The U.S. and other western democracies are mostly market economies, but none are pure market economies. In these countries, the government still sets some economic rules, and it produces some goods itself (e.g., public education, fire and police protection, and infrastructure such as roads and bridges).

##### Normative versus descriptive statements

A **descriptive statement** is one that describes some aspect of the world---or, at least, attempts to do so. Such a statement can be false, and it will still be a descriptive statement; it will just be a false one. A **normative statement** expresses what should or ought to be the case. Some textbooks describe normative statements as opinions, but that's not correct. 'You should not kill your next-door neighbor' is a normative statement, but it's not just a matter of opinion. It is, however, a statement that has to be justified using different methods than are used to justify or confirm descriptive statements. We find out if a positive statement is true or false by examining the world and collecting data. We can't do that for normative statements, but we can still justify them and try to decide if they are correct or not. Here are some examples of the two kinds of statements.

1. 'In 2021, the Federal budget deficit was \$2.77 trillion' is a descriptive statement.

2. 'The Federal budget deficit should be lower' is a normative statement.

3. 'You should save 15 percent of your monthly income' is a normative statement.

4. 'This Federal policy will make 12 million people better off and no one worse off' is a descriptive statement.

5. 'The government should implement a policy that will make 12 million people better off and no one worse off' is a normative statement.

As you can see from these examples, normative and descriptive statements can be related. Economics, like all sciences, is concerned with the descriptive. But, economists, understanding this science as they do, are often inclined to offer (and argue for, defend, and try to justify) normative statements.

##### Marginal benefit, marginal analysis, and marginal utility

**Marginal**, in the sense that we will use it, has a meaning close to *additional*. So, a *marginal analysis* examines the cost or benefit of consuming (or producing) an additional unit of a good. The marginal benefit is the benefit that is added by consuming (or producing) another unit. E.g., what is the benefit of one more hour of studying? If it's your first or second hour of studying, then the benefit will be high. If it's your 30th hour of continuous studying, then the benefit will probably be low. Or, e.g., what is the cost of manufacturing one more car at a factory? Again, it depends where on the spectrum this additional unit is.

**Utility**, as it is used in economics, means something like "having one's preferences satisfied," but it's not all or nothing. Any event provides some number of units of utility (including zero, and perhaps negative amounts). *Utility* is not the same as *happiness*, but *happiness* is sometimes a good substitute when thinking about how economic decisions might affect a person's utility.

Now, to introduce the concept of **marginal utility**, let's consider a made up example.

Let's say that when Bill Gates started Microsoft, he had \$2,000 in his personal bank account. Then, after one year, he had \$5 million. After the second year, he had \$10 million, after the third he had \$15 million, and so on for the next nine years. Each year he added \$5 million to his personal savings (except for the first, when he added \$4,998,000, and so after 12 years he had \$60 million. Now, consider these questions.

1. Just counting the happiness that he derived from his money, which individual year do you think made him the happiest? Or otherwise stated, in which year did he achieve the greatest increase in utility?

2. Just counting the happiness that he derived from this money, at which point do you think he was happiest? Or otherwise stated, at which point, in these 12 years, was his utility the highest?

Assuming that Bill Gates, at least in this early part of his career, is like rest of us, we would expect that the largest increase in utility occurs in the first year, when his wealth increases from \$2,000 to \$5,000,000. It is good to have \$2,000 in one's bank account. This amount will cover many emergency or unexpected expenses, and temporary periods of unemployment. But having \$5,000,000 is altogether different. This is more than enough to provide many luxuries and financial stability for a lifetime.

Now, let's consider year 12. At the beginning of this year, our fictional Bill Gates had \$55 million. By the end of it, he has \$60 million. We would expect this additional \$5 million to increase his utility (or happiness) a bit, but by less than any of the other increases of \$5 million. Having \$60 million is, presumably, better than having \$55 million, but it's not likely to change a person's well-being, happiness, or utility by much. Most of the things that you can do with \$60 million, you can already do with \$55 million.

</div>
<div class="caption"><div align="left">
<strong>Figure 6</strong>  The utility that each additional $5,000,000 creates over 12 consecutive years. We typically expect that each additional unit of a good&mdash;in this case each additional $5,000,000&mdash;will bring a smaller amount of happiness (or utility) than the previous one.</div>
</div>
</div>

Utility is subjective, and so the real Bill Gates's (or anyone else's) actual utility might be different, but generally speaking we would expect that the first \$5 million would cause the largest increase in utility (or happiness), the last \$5 million would cause the smallest increase, and each year in between would be lower than the previous one.

This is not to say, however, that our fictional Bill Gates was losing utility (or happiness) each year. Figure 5 shows the utility created by the additional \$5 million that he acquired each year. We would expect his *total* utility (based just on this increasing wealth---the real Bill Gates, like everyone, had other things going on in his life) to be increasing each year. This is illustrated in figure 6. But, as this this figure shows, marginal utility---that is, the additional amount of utility created by each additional \$5 million---is getting smaller or decreasing each year.

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-11">

	</div>
</div>
<div class="caption"><div align="left">
<strong>Figure 6</strong></div>
</div>
</div>

The tendency for marginal utility to decrease as a person gets more and more of a good is called the **law of diminishing marginal utility**. As a person receives more or a good, the additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. The first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth; the first \$5 million brings more satisfaction than the twelfth, and so forth.

In the Bill Gates example, if we stretch it out many more years, we might expect that each additional \$5 million that he acquires will bring at least a small increase in utility, although, perhaps, at some point, the increases will become so small that they will be negligible. In other cases, however, additional units of a good might cause unhappiness or a loss of utility, in which case more of the good will cause total utility to start falling. This would be expected, for example, if someone, even if he or she loves pizza, keeps eating slices to the point of throwing up.


##### Opportunity cost

The **opportunity cost** of a decision is the value of next best alternative. In other words, it is the value of what we give up when we make a decision. For example, maybe you went to the gym this morning. (And if you didn't, let's imagine that you did.) If you hadn't gone to the gym, what would you have been doing? Perhaps sleeping or studying or hanging out with friends. The opportunity cost of going to the gym is the best one (or most valuable one) of these other options. (But only the best one, not all of them.) Let's say that the next best choice for you would have spending an hour at a local coffee shop doing homework. So, the cost of going to the gym (i.e., the opportunity cost) is this hour at the coffee shop. Every decision, by definition, involves at least two options, and so every choice that is made has an opportunity cost.

When we purchase a good or service, the opportunity cost can often be treated as the price of whatever we purchased. For instance, if you buy a new bicycle for $700, the $700 is a measure of the other things that you could have purchased, and for practical purposes, there may be no special need to identify the alternative product or products that you could have bought with that $700. Sometimes, however, the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true opportunity cost of a decision. This problem can loom especially large when part (or all) of the cost of an activity includes time spent doing one thing rather than another.

For instance, although attending and graduating from college is, for most people, a very important and valuable activity, attending college is costly. There are the costs of tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. But in addition to those expenses, there are the alternative ways that a person could be using all of the time that he or she is devoted to college.
