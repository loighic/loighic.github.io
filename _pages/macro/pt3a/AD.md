##### A model of the U.S. economy

We have already encountered two economic models. First, rather briefly, the [circular flow diagram](https://loighic.net/macro/intro1/), which describes the flow of economic activity between households and firms. And second, the [supply and demand model](https://loighic.net/macro/supply_and_demand/) describes how prices and quantities for a single good or service will change in response to changes to demand or to supply.

Now, we will investigate a model of the entire U.S. economy: **the aggregate demand - aggregate supply model (AD-AS model)**. This is a relatively simple model (and there are many, much more complex models in macroeconomics), but it will give us insight into when and why GDP, the price level, and unemployment increase and decrease.

As the name of the model suggests, the two components that are modeled are *aggregate demand* and *aggregate supply*. We will take each in turn, and then put them together.

##### Aggregate demand

**Aggregate demand** (AD) is the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy. When we graph aggregate demand, we put real GDP---or in other words, total output---on the vertical axis. On the vertical axis, we use a *price index*.


You may recall that the GDP deflator is the index that goes with GDP, and so that is the index that we are using, although, for the purpose of understanding this model, we won't bother to calculate the GDP deflator. We will just use index numbers between about 80 and 120 and track changes to the price level, which constitute inflation or deflation. For example, a change from 100 to 105 would be a 5% increase in prices (on average); while a change from 100 t0 90 would be 10% decrease in prices (on average).

So, the amounts of aggregate demand are given in terms of total output (i.e., GDP), and each amount correspond to a price level.

The aggregate demand curve represents the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level. It includes all four of the components of demand that we covered when discussing GDP: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports).

It is worth keeping in mind that aggregate demand is defined in terms of total spending, and for the model that we are developing here, we no longer have the microeconomic focus on individual consumers getting what they want. As you will see once we have a complete picture of the model, our interest now is how we can keep GDP close to its potential and unemployment low.


##### Why does the AD curve slope downward?

The answer to this question is different---and a little more complicated than---the reason why the demand curve typically slopes downward. Now, we are thinking about why and how changes to the price level (i.e., the index on the vertical axis) affects total demand.

There are three ways that total demand is affected by changes to the price level, which correspond to three of the components of demand: consumption, investment, and net exports. For the sake of this analysis, we can treat government spending as a constant that is set by government policy and isn't affected by changes to the price level.

###### The real wealth effect

As you may know, *wealth* and *income* are not the same, a point to which we will return later. Right now, what really interests us is income and savings. Let's say that in your checking and savings accounts, you have a total of \$1000. Suddenly, the price level drops from 100 to 96. This means that prices for all goods and services have fallen by 4%. The \$1000 that you have is still \$1000, but the real value of that \$1000 has increased. Hence, you are wealthier. (Yay!)

The same will be true for all consumers, and this increase in everyone's wealth will tend to increase the consumer spending portion of demand (i.e., consumption). Since consumption is a portion of aggregate demand, aggregate demand increases. And since the levels of aggregate demand are measured in terms of GDP, GDP increases.

Conversely, if the price level increases---from say, 100 to 104---then the real value of your \$1000 will go down. The same will be true for all consumers, which will tend to decrease consumer spending.

###### The interest rate effect

Banking is an interesting service. When we use banks, we are safely storing our money, we are paid for doing so (with interest), and we can access it whenever we want (sometimes with some conditions). Banks, however, aren't charities. They make money. They do so by making loans and charging interest on those loans. (And the bank will receive a higher rate of interest on the loans than they will pay to savers for depositing their money in the bank.)

The more money that savers (i.e., people who are saving some of their money) deposit with a bank, the more loans the bank can make. The less money that savers deposit, the fewer loans the bank can make. This in turn, affects interest rates---both the interest rate that savers receive and the interest rate on loans.

Let's return to changes to the price level. When the price level goes down, consumers, firms, and government need less money to purchase goods and services. Some of their unspent money will be moved into savings. Hence, the supply of savings (or "loanable funds") increases. 

Just as it does for any other market, when supply increases and demand remains the same, the equilibrium price will fall. In the case of savings (i.e., loanable funds), the price is an interest rate, which is paid to savers.

<strong>Figure 2: Supply and demand for loanable funds.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Loanable funds are savings put into banks (and also money used to buy government bonds). Initially, the supply of loanable funds is provided by savers, and the demand for loanable funds comes from banks. The price paid for loanable funds is a rate of interest.</div>
</div>
</div>


Once they have deposits, banks can use that money to make loans. Now, they are the suppliers of loanable funds, and demand is from individuals or other parties who need loans. But the effect is the same. The banks' supply of loanable funds has increased, and so the interest rate for whoever takes out loans decreases.

Lower interest rates will encourage companies to borrow and spend on factories, equipment, and other investment goods. Similarly, consumers will be more likely to borrow and purchase "big ticket" items such as houses and cars (the first of which is included in the investment category of demand). This spending increases aggregate demand---or in other words, GDP.

Conversely, if the price level increases, then consumers, firms, and the government will need more money to purchase goods and services, leaving less to save. Thus, the supply of loanable funds will decrease, which will cause interest rates to rise.


###### The foreign price effect

When the price level goes down in the United States and it remains unchanged in other countries, demand for U.S. exports will increase because our goods and services are suddenly cheaper relative to the goods produced in other countries.

On the other hand, if the price level goes up in the U.S. and it remains unchanged in other countries, then consumers and firms in the U.S. will purchase more imports. When this happens, not much has changed as far as these purchasers in the U.S. are concerned. They are still getting the goods and services that they want. But since aggregate demand is measured as GDP, it is only tracking demand for domestically produced goods and services. Imports, recall, are subtracted from GDP, but also, in the scenario that we are considering here, imports are pushing out demand for the more expensive domestically produced goods and services. Consequently, GDP will decrease.

##### The shape of the AD curve

These three effects cause the aggregate demand curve to slope downward, but they are not actually thought to be very large effects. This means that a change to the price level does not seem to have too much effect on the quantity of goods and services demanded. This might be what we should expect. For most people, most of their purchases can't change too much. They still need food, clothing, somewhere to live, and transportation. And, especially if the price level is only changing by a low single digit percentage, most people won't have too much incentive to make much of a change to the amounts of goods and services that they purchase.

This is not to say that a change to the price level won't have any effect on aggregate demand. If a change to the price level had no effect on the quantity of goods and services demanded, then the aggregate demand curve would be a vertical line. Because of the *real wealth effect*, the *interest rate effect*, and the *foreign price effect*, it's not that, but it is a curve with a very steep slope as shown in figure 3.
