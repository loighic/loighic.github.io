##### <span style="color:magenta">SUMMER 2024</span>

**<span style="color:blue">August 8 - 21</span>:** I can only meet on Webex, and probably only between 1:00 and 6:00 pm---but any day of the week. 

**<span style="color:blue">August 22 - August 6</span>:** I can meet on Webex or in my office in George Hall, and I will usually be available from around 10:00 am to 7:00 pm---again, any day of the week.  

If you want to meet, while keeping these times in mind, just let me know when would be a good time (or times) for you.

##### SPRING 2024

I can meet on Webex or in my office on campus. This semester, these are the best times for me to meet with students:

>**Mondays:** from 9:30 am until 6:00 pm
>
>**Tuesdays and Thursdays:** from 9:30 until 11:00 and 2:00 to 3:00 
>
>**Fridays and weekends:** various times (probably). As long as I'm available, Webex meetings on the weekend aren't a problem. 

If you want to meet, while keeping these times in mind, just let me know when would be a good time (or times) for you.
