##### SPRING 2024

I can meet on Webex or in my office on campus. This semester, these are the best times for me to meet with students:

>**Mondays:** from 9:30 am until 6:00 pm
>
>**Tuesdays and Thursdays:** from 9:30 until 11:00 and 2:00 to 3:00 
>
>**Fridays and weekends:** various times (probably). As long as I'm available, Webex meetings on the weekend aren't a problem. 

If you want to meet, while keeping these times in mind, just let me know when would be a good time (or times) for you.
