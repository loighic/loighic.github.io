##### SPRING 2024

Coming soon!

##### FALL 2023

I can meet on Webex or in my office on campus. This semester, these are the best times for me to meet with students:
>
**Mondays and Wednesdays:** from 10:00 am until about 3:00 pm
> 
**Tuesdays and Thursdays:** from 2:00 until 6:00 pm 
>
**Fridays and weekends:** various times (probably). As long as I'm available, Webex meetings on the weekend aren't a problem. 

If you want to meet, while keeping these times in mind, just let me know when would be a good time (or times) for you.
