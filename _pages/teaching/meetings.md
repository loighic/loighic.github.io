##### SUMMER 2025

This term, I will have to do all meetings on Webex. Generally, I'll be able to meet any time between 10:00 am and 6:00 pm (Central time)---or possibly later---any day of the week. If you want to meet, just let me know when would be a good time (or times) for you.

##### SPRING 2025

I can meet on Webex or in my office on campus. This semester, these are the best times for me to meet with students:

>**Mondays and Wednesdays:** 9:30 am to 5:30 pm
>
>**Tuesdays and Thursdays:** 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm
>
>**Fridays and weekends:** Various times (probably). As long as I'm available, Webex meetings on the weekend aren't a problem. 

If you want to meet, while keeping these times in mind, just let me know when would be a good time (or times) for you.
