On p. 19, the second-to-last paragraph should begin "With that in mind and speaking very generally,"

Premise 1 of the induction by confirmation (in chapter 2) should begin with “The hypothesis is …” or “The hypothesis is the following.” If that premise simply states the hypothesis, then the hypothesis can be repeated in the conclusion and the argument will be valid.

On p. 66, in line 3 of premise 2, it should be “(and possibly on the day that he died)”.

On p. 141, the last line in table 5.4 should be “30   females who smoke.”
