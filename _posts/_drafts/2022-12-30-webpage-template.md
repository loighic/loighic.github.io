[Academic wepage template](https://loighic.net/assets/default4.html)

This is a one-page website that is suitable for someone who wants to provide a little bit of information about themselves, a CV, a list of publications, and maybe some other simple content. I took the code and design from [Jane Friedman](https://jfriedmanphilo.github.io/), made some changes, and used it for a while. I think that it's a good design, and it's simple to maintain. This software is licensed under the [MIT license].

The simplest (and free-est) way to set this up as your own webpage is to have your university host it or to use [github pages] (https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site). 

Download the file here . . .  You will have to go through the html code to update it with your own content, but you should be able to find and replace what's there with your own content pretty easily. 

Line 9: The webpage title, this is the title that appears in the browser tab. Right now it is "melanochaita," and you can leave that title. Typically, for this kind of website, people put their name. 

Line 169: Replace "ACADEMIC WEBPAGE TEMPLATE" with your name. You might want to use all caps.

Line 202: The list of publications and the second column of the website begins here.
