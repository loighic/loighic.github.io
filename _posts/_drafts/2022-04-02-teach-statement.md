This is a teaching statement that I wrote for a review that I had to do in 2023. I think that teaching statements are difficult to write, especially for those of us who teach philosophy. Of course, getting your students to *really*, *really* think is a good goal, but it can be difficult to convey how effective you are at this in a teaching statement. And, on the other hand, a large part of effective teaching depends on executing many, many details correctly. Cataloguing your abilities here, however, can be a little dry. 

That said, I don’t know how to write the perfect teaching statement, and I wouldn’t recommend that anyone follow mine too closely. But, perhaps, looking at it might be useful for getting some ideas if you have to compose your own. From a different angle, my students might also be curious to read my teaching statement, and so here it is.

##### **1. How should I teach college courses?**

I began thinking about this question seriously when, in graduate school, I read a short essay by Derek Bok, the former president of Harvard University.[^1] Bok argues that undergraduates could and should be learning more than they are. When they leave college, most have made little or no improvement to their critical reasoning, moral reasoning, quantitative, foreign language, or writing skills. He also explains that educational research, which is often overlooked by faculty, shows that various forms of “active learning” are more effective than lectures for learning and improving critical thinking. His reasons for concern are practical. College graduates are often unprepared for the jobs they land, “forcing employers to pay increasing sums to remedy deficiencies in the writing and computational skills of the college graduates they hire.” While at the same time, these graduates are competing, not only with each other, but with “hordes of ambitious, hard-working young people from countries such as India and China intent on claiming a piece of the world’s most prosperous economy.” 

[^1]: Bok, D. (December 18, 2005). “[Are colleges failing? Higher ed needs new lesson plans](http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/12/18/are_colleges_failing/).” *The Boston Globe*.

My approach to teaching has also been influenced by the physicist Eric Mazur who has taught introductory physics at Harvard since the early 1980s. In 1990, Mazur read an article by the physicist David Hestenes that reported the results of a short test Hestenes had created to assess—using everyday language and without formulas or equations—students’ understanding of basic concepts in Newtonian mechanics. Mazur’s students could pass the difficult exams that he gave them and he received excellent reviews from his students, but when he gave them Hestenes’ test, he found that most lacked a genuine understanding of the physics they were being taught.[^2] Later, while trying to explain the concept underlying one of the questions, he discovered what he has since termed “peer instruction.” David Epstein takes up the story:

[^2]: Travis, J. (1994). “Why Eric Mazur brings chaos—not chaos theory—to physics,” *Science*, 266, 890+893. Mazur, E. (2009). “Farewell, lecture?” *Science*, 323, 50 - 51.

>
Mazur realized that the students had become quite adept at solving problems by rote, but not at applying concepts. So the next time he taught the course, he took some class time to explain some of the misconceptions exposed by the test. “I turned and looked at them, 80 students or so, and they looked totally confused,” he said, “as if my explanation had made them more confused. They were silent, so confused they couldn’t even formulate a question.” From the test results, Mazur knew that about half of the students understood the concept he was trying to explain. “On a whim, I said ‘why don’t you turn to your neighbor and convince them of your answer,’” he said. “The whole room burst into chaos.”[^3]
>

[^3]: Epstein, D. (March 15, 2006). “[Peer to Peer](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/03/15/peer-peer)." *Inside Higher Ed*.

The students were eager to debate, defend, and explain their answers to their peers, and so Mazur reorganized his introductory physics course around this interaction. He now begins each class by giving the students a brief quiz to verify that they have done the assigned reading. Then, instead of spending the whole class period lecturing, he gives a series short explanations or demonstrations of the material that he wants to cover. After each demonstration, he gives the students conceptual multiple-choice questions to assess their understanding. First, each student answers on his or her own. Then, as Mazur explains, 

>
After the students have recorded their answer, I ask them to try to convince their neighbors of their answer. The ensuing discussions are surprisingly animated. After a minute or so, I again ask the students to select an answer (one can use a show of hands, flashcards, scanning forms, or a computerized voting system). The proportion of students who chose the correct answer always increases after the discussion, suggesting that the students are successfully explaining their reasoning, and in the process teaching each other. If about half the students select the right answer (with the correct reasoning) before discussion, a minute or so of discussion is sufficient to dramatically improve the level of understanding of the class. No lecturer, however engaging and lucid, can achieve this level of involvement and participation simply by speaking. (1997, p. 983)[^4]

Another physicist who has adopted this method, Albert Altman of the University of Massachusetts Lowell says, “Some of the discussions are truly marvelous. They sound like faculty members talking to one another” (Travis, p. 890). Data collected by Mazur and physics instructors at other institutions also shows that, when students are given Hestenes’ concept test at the beginning and at the end of term, the peer instruction method increases the gains that are made on the post-tests (as compared to the gains made in traditional lecture courses). Mazur has also found that students in the peer instruction courses do better than those in lecture courses on the same or comparable midterm and final exam questions. And using peer instruction has reduced the gender gap in the introductory physics courses at Harvard. When the traditional lecture method is used, Mazur found that male students outperform female students on the end-of-term concept test (the post-test). But when the course is taught with peer instruction, male and female students perform equally well on the post-test. And teaching with peer instruction has significantly reduced the gap between the percentage of men and women who received A grades in the introductory physics courses at Harvard.[^5]

##### **2. Three principles**

###### **2.1 Be effective.**

Prior to reading Bok’s essay, I thought of teaching a college course as something that had to be done, but which had few, if any, effects beyond the completion of the course—other than designating the grades that would go on students’ transcripts. Of course, I had to make a decision about being a certain type of teacher—easy, hard, funny, stern, organized, affectionally disorganized, or whatever it might be—and the students had to do the right kinds of assignments. But after it was over, their “feeling” about the course was all that most students were likely to take away from it. Reading Bok’s essay made me realize that college teaching is important. Every student has goals for his or her life, and, whether they acknowledge it or not, a college education has an important role in the pursuit of those goals.

Finding out that most students achieve less than they could in college and that there are better and worse ways to teach changed my mindset. As I will explain in section 3, I teach different types of courses and use different delivery methods. But for all of them, my goal is always that the students, not only become acquainted with the course’s content, but also improve some of these skills (different skills are stressed in different courses): critical thinking, the ability to learn, problem solving, reading comprehension, writing, explaining complex ideas, and working effectively in small groups.

###### **2.2 Think about the students’ future careers.** 

As a philosopher, I, of course, believe that intellectual pursuits are worthwhile for their own sake. But, when thinking about what should be achieved in philosophy and economics courses that enroll mostly non-majors, I gravitate to the students’, hopefully successful, post-college lives. The following are two related points that I keep in mind. 

**(a)** Learning cannot end when students graduate from college. Even in periods of high economic and career stability, white collar jobs require continuous learning. And over the next several decades, most people may experience less career stability than was the norm in the past. New jobs—ones that don’t exist now—will be created, some jobs that exist now will radically change, and some that exist now will disappear. Hence, students need to be able to continuously learn, sometimes while working independently and sometimes while working with others; they need to be able to take their reasoning and critical think skills and transfer them to new domains; and they need to be able to approach and solve novel problems. 

**(b)** Students, even older ones, may think that they know what they will do after they graduate. In some cases, they may be right (and the jobs that they have selected will continue to exist), but some will adopt new career goals. Hence, I don’t think that they should be taught with the attitude that “this student is going to be a nurse or an accountant (or whatever), and so any general requirement or elective courses (like, say, philosophy) that he or she takes can be light or fluffy.” Students will make all kinds of changes to the paths that they take after college, but I think about the student who might decide after graduating that he or she would like to go to law school.[^6] I do not teach pre-law courses, and my courses are not, specifically, a preparation for law school. But I find the possibility that a student could, someday, want to go to law school a useful reminder to hew to a teaching process where students must read, work on comprehension, think about what they have read, and discuss it. Students may, in the moment, wish to take the simplest possible route through a philosophy course. But if, years later, they decide to go to law school, I want them, realistically, to have the opportunity and to be positioned to successfully begin.  

[^6]: I don’t have any feelings one way or the other about the merits of attending law school—and maybe I don’t even have a realistic understanding of what it generally entails. But my impression is that law school courses require students to come to class having done the assigned reading and prepared to discuss and debate it. Moreover, given that there isn’t a specific undergraduate preparation for law school, I think that all students who have graduated from a College of Arts & Sciences (and probably from other units as well) should be able to pursue law school if they wish.

###### **2.3 Guided, student-based learning.** 

Mazur had two insights. The first, which was also mentioned by Bok in his essay, is that lecturing is not the most effective teaching method. Mazur’s other insight is that what is most effect is having the students teach each other. I agree that, when it’s feasible, some form of active learning is preferable to lecturing to the students. Mazur is speaking casually here, but the point is a forceful one:

>
I used to get in front of my students and do all the science for them. I should have been showing them how to do it themselves. If they were studying the piano, I wouldn’t have gone, “sit down, I’ll play the piano for you.” [^7]

Regarding the peer instruction itself, it’s complicated. I will discuss the types of courses that I teach and the delivery methods by which those courses are offered in the next section. Right now, I’ll just say that, across courses, I teach very different types of content. (Although I reject to notion that they require or use different cognitive skills and abilities, learning how to do [proofs]( https://youtu.be/T5kw4u_k8yw?t=110) in logic doesn’t much resemble trying to understand the [free will debate]( https://loighic.net/assets/pdf/intro/libertarianism_and_determinism.pdf).) Hence, the extent to which—as well as why—I have students work in groups varies. I will have more to say about this also in the next section, but for now I will be brief: although I often have students work in groups during class meetings, I don’t all the time. Consequently, the general teaching method that I use, which I call guided, student-based learning, while inspired by Mazur, is an adaptation.

Here is how I describe this method for my students:

>
If there was a pill that I could give you that would immediately implant all of the information for this course directly into your brain, I wouldn’t give it to you. The reason I wouldn’t is because an important part of the course is going through the learning process yourself and getting better at it—better at reading, thinking, looking for answers, figuring things out. Learning is, in its own right, an important skill. And it’s a skill like any other: you can always be better at it, and it’s improved by practicing. 

Moreover, learning is a skill that you will still need after you graduate from college. As a dean at one of the country’s top medical schools says, “One of the goals of this whole model—of having students do a lot of the learning themselves rather than passively listening—is that they need to be lifelong learners.”[^8] 

(Actually, I would give you the pill because it would be really cool. But, alas, that’s not an option.)

Sometimes, following Mazur’s method, students working in small groups is the context for the student-based learning. Sometimes, especially in asynchronous online courses, students work independently. And sometimes, the class and I work together as one group. The important feature of this method is that the students must actively engage with the learning process. I never simply present the material to them and let them passively view and memorize it—and, in fact, I require very little memorization in my courses. Of course, zero learning would occur if I just gave the students a syllabus and let them do what they might. I create and then guide the process that the students follow, and so it is *guided*. As Mazur puts it, much more learning occurs now that he is “the guide on the side” instead of “the sage on the stage.”[^9]

##### **3. Courses**

###### **3.1 The types of courses that I teach.** 

The courses that I teach can be categorized in two ways. First, in terms of content, there are (*a*) “reading oriented” courses (E.g., Intro to Philosophy, Business Ethics) and (*b*) “problem solving oriented” courses (primarily, Intro to Logic, Principles of Macroeconomics, and Game Theory). There is not a completely sharp distinction between (*a*) and (*b*), but the reading oriented courses are more focused on reading comprehension, evaluating the authors’ positions, and writing. Reading is still an important feature of the problem solving courses, but in these, its purpose is mainly to facilitate learning the material. The central goal of the problem solving courses is learning the relevant methods and then (as one would expect) applying them to solve problems. (The reading-oriented courses also include problem solving—for instance, *‘how does the author’s position, as it is described in the second section of her article, apply to this case?’* But, here, the problem is less structured and there isn’t exactly a method, other than comprehension and critical thinking, that can be used to solve it.) The second way of categorizing my courses is by their delivery method: asynchronous online, synchronous online, and in the classroom (and although students who cannot make it to a classroom meeting sometimes join online, I don’t mix synchronous online and classroom teaching by design). The table shows some of the important features of each of the six-resulting options that I have.

###### **3.2 The framework for reading oriented and problem solving oriented courses in the classroom.** 

Although the asynchronous online courses that I teach are sometimes rather large, I have been fortunate that my the classroom and synchronous online courses are small. (Except for one two-way video course in Fall 2013, all of my classroom courses have had under 30 students and all of my synchronous online courses have had 15 to 20.) As a consequence, I am not forced to lecture, and so I have adopted these two methods for my classroom courses. [^10]
[^10]: Although currently, more of my courses are online (synchronously and asynchronously) than are in the classroom, since teaching in the classroom is the traditional and still, I believe, most common delivery method at Mississippi State, I will describe classroom teaching here. When I teach in the classroom, the courses usually meet once per week for 2.5 hours, and so what I lay out here will be based on that schedule.

*(a)* In my reading oriented courses, I begin each class with a short, closed book quiz to check that the students have done the assigned reading. The questions on these quizzes mainly require recognizing fairly obvious details in the article or chapter (e.g., In chapter 2, Sandel discusses hunting which animal? (a) walruses, (b) wild boars, (c) giraffes, (d) white tailed deer, (e) ostriches.). Or sometimes a question may require identifying the author’s main position on the issue addressed in the article or chapter. Then, we spend the main part of the meeting going over the reading, which all of the students have printed out and with them. Realistically, it’s not possible to have the students do the assigned reading before the class meeting and then for us to spend the class time discussing it. Even with optimally selected books and articles, the majority of the students’ comprehension won’t be sufficient to launch directly into a meaningful discussion. [^11] But, at the same time, I don’t simply tell them what they need to know about the reading. Doing the reading on their own is the first step in the process of comprehending and evaluating it. Going over it in class is the second step. 
While they have the article or chapter in front of them, I ask the students questions. These, generally, require the students to look over the reading, and often take some work and time to get right. Listed here are some of the questions that I ask the students about a chapter on the mind in Intro to Philosophy. 

[^11]: For both reading and problem solving oriented courses, I believe that one of the most important aspects of teaching is selecting, or in some cases creating, texts that students can, and are required to, read on their own before the class meetings. Hence, I have written two logic textbooks, and the article “What is ethics anyway?” (published in the literary magazine *The Montreal Review*, although I use a [longer version]( https://loighic.net/assets/pdf/intro/What_Is_Ethics_Anyway.pdf) in Intro to Philosophy and Business Ethics).  And, even if I am not writing them myself, I spend a lot of time looking for appropriate texts so that the students can effectively begin the learning process on their own before we meet.

1. What are the possible criteria for having a mind that are discussed in the first section of the chapter?

2. How does the Turing test work? What question would you ask if you were the judge?

3. Where is “philosophical zombie” first mentioned in the chapter? What is a “philosophical zombie”?

4. (thought question) Besides human beings, what is another type of creature (or animal) that you think, most likely has conscious experiences? 

5. (thought question) What is the creature (or animal) that is most different than human beings but which you think, most likely, has conscious experiences? 

6. Read the first six lines of the Descartes quote. This (up to the semicolon) is an argument. What are the premises and the conclusion?

Once we figure out the answers to each, I will write some or all of them down, which usually compels the students to think about them a bit more, to seek clarification if need be, and take their own notes; it also keeps the pace of the class from going too fast.[^12]

[^12]: I use a laptop that has a screen on which I can write with a stylus. And this is projected on the display at the front of the classroom.

In these courses, the students spend the last 30 minutes taking open-book and -notes quizzes—usually consisting of multiple-choice questions—in groups of three or four. Sticking with the chapter on the mind, these are three of the questions that were given in one of these group quizzes:
	
1. Which one of the following is the best description of the problem of other minds?

    (a) Although we can tell that our own minds are different than material things, we cannot check or investigate if other people’s minds are different than material things.
	
    (b) Although it is reasonable to assume that other people have minds like yours, since no theory of the mind can explain consciousness, it is not possible to be certain that other people have conscious minds.
    
	(c) Since everything from computers to pens perform certain functions, almost every object has a mind.
    
	*(d)* Although it is reasonable to assume that other people have minds like yours, since you can’t check or observe the experiences that other people have, it is not possible to be certain that other people have conscious minds.

2. In section 2 of the chapter on mind, the author writes, “Many movies have been made about two characters who swap bodies—The Change Up (2011), Freaky Friday (2003), Vice Versa (1988), 18 Again! (1988), Like Father, Like Son (1987), and others.” Which one of the following best describes the point that is being made when discussing these movies?

    (a) If we probe the details of Descartes’ theory, we find that they are unclear and, possibly, contradictory.

    (b) Understanding the basic plots of these movies requires rejecting Cartesian dualism.

    *(c)* There are features of Cartesian dualism that are easily and widely understood.

    (d) All of these movies have dialogue that mention Rene Descartes. Hence, Descartes is, in a way, part of our culture.

3. How is the *desire for a beer* defined in the example on p. 17?

    (a) It is a mental state that is identical to activity in the brain’s frontal lobe.

    *(b)* It is the mental state that is caused by the belief that it is 6:00 pm and causes walking into the kitchen.

    (c) It is the mental state that is caused by a desire for a beer. 

    (d) It is a mental state that is caused by a particular combination of genes and environmental factors.

**(b)** In the problem-solving courses that meet in the classroom, the students are always in groups. Here, I typically don’t begin class with a quiz, although I sometimes give them some “warm-up” review problems to do before we start. Then, I follow Mazur’s method and intersperse short explanations of the material with problems that the students work on in groups. (Sometimes, during my explanations, I will put questions to the whole class that they can answer either based on the reading or what we have covered previously. I really don’t like speaking continuously for too long in the classroom.) Generally, the work that the students do in groups during the main part of the class meeting is not graded. As in the reading oriented courses, though, I end the class period with an open-book and -notes, group quiz. For these courses, the questions often are not multiple choice, and sometimes the quizzes are longer than 30 minutes.


###### **3.3 Delivering the delivery method.** 

I think that each of the delivery methods—classroom, synchronous online, and asynchronous online—has strengths, and that students are best served by taking a mix of all three. To the extent that I can, I try to design and organize each course around its delivery method, rather than simply moving the content from one delivery method to another. Since I have already discussed the outline of my classroom courses, here I describe my approach to synchronous and asynchronous online courses.

**(a)** Synchronous online courses have several strengths. [^13] Every student is, in effect, sitting in the front row and directly seeing me, their classmates, and my screen when I share it. Consequently, the baseline level of engagement is high. Jonathan Katzman, Matt Regan, and Ari Bader-Natal, who helped to develop the videoconferencing software used at Minerva University, put it this way, “we [need] every student to feel as though he or she [is] sitting right next to the professor in every class; this is the position that gets you the most attention in a traditional classroom, which in turn leads to intense and interactive experiences.” [^14] I can also, using the Vevox app, give the students written or multiple-choice questions at any time during the class meeting. (The questions will just appear on their screens, and I can track the answers as they are submitted.) And, with Read’s Analytics app, I can measure each student’s participation time during the meeting. Granted, it takes buy-in from the students for courses taught this way to work well, especially since it is a relatively new delivery method. But it’s an interesting option, and, at least for some types of courses, seems to have a lot of potential. 

[^13]: When I teach synchronous online courses (and again, these are courses with 20 or fewer students in them), the students are required to have their video on for the entire class meeting and to be sitting at a desk or table with their phones away. I use the Microsoft Surface Pro laptop and one or two additional monitors so that I can write on the Surface Pro screen and display it for the students, while also seeing all of them.

[^14]: P. 204 in Katzman, J., Regan, M., & Bader-Natal, A. (2017). “The active learning forum.” In S. M. Kosslyn & B. Nelson (Eds.), *Building the Intentional University* (pp. 203 - 220). MIT Press. Minerva University is interesting because, even though their students are in one location, all of their courses are taught synchronously online. They make a compelling argument that courses taught this way can be more effective than those that are taught in the classroom (see Katzman, Regan, & Bader-Natal), although I’m not aware of a report of a study showing that it is.


**(b)** I think that all students should take a couple of asynchronous online courses while they are in college because they help to develop the ability to work independently. To do these courses, students have to be organized and have a greater degree of initiative over their involvement in the course. This method also necessitates that, other than sending group emails, all of the interactions that I have with the students—emails, Webex meetings, feedback on assignments—is personal and one-on-one. There are, of course, other ways to get such interaction with faculty, but for the students who can’t or don’t seek it out, this ensures that they have the experience during college. 

For asynchronous online courses, I don’t try to recreate the experience of being in the classroom. Rather, I give the students the support that they need to explore the material themselves. For reading-oriented asynchronous online courses, this includes videos of me [reading]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-YKL64zEMg&t=58s) the articles and chapters, some notes, and assignments that draw the students through the process of engaging with the assigned readings—i.e., starting with (a) quizzes that can be take twice and contain questions that just require finding the right spot in the reading and working to (b) assignments that require the [application]( https://loighic.net/assets/pdf/be/shhw/) of concepts, ideas, or theories. For problem-solving asynchronous online courses, the videos that I provide are short explanations or demonstrations of the material; the assignments, again, draw the students through the process of learning the material; and I often meet with students one-on-one on Webex or in-person.
